## What problem does it solve?

Traditional book lending and borrowing methods can be inaccessible, expensive, and inefficient. ReProse addresses this by creating a seamless digital platform that allows students and book enthusiasts to connect, share, and trade books effortlessly. This helps reduce the financial burden of purchasing books, promotes sustainability by extending the life of books, and fosters a more inclusive learning environment.

## How does it work?

ReProse connects users who want to lend, borrow, or sell books. It provides an intuitive interface where users can list books for sale or lending, browse available books, and communicate with potential buyers or borrowers. The platform simplifies the exchange process, ensuring a smooth and secure experience.
